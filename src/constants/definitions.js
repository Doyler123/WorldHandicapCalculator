    sss: `Course Rating (CR) or Standard Scratch (SSS) is the number of strokes a scratch golfer 
        is expected to score around the course under normal mid-season conditions. The CR or SSS can 
        usually be found on your clubs scorecard.`,
    slope: `A "Slope Rating" is the USGA's mark that indicates the measurement of the relative difficulty of a course for
        players who are not scratch golfers compared to the USGA Course Rating (e.g., compared to the difficulty of a
        course for scratch golfers). A Slope Rating is computed from the difference between the Bogey Rating and
        the USGA Course Rating. The lowest Slope Rating is 55 and the highest is 155. A golf course of standard playing
        difficulty has a Slope Rating of 113. If a course does not yet have a slope rating, an average slope rating 
        of 125 will be used for calculation purposes`,
    css: `The Competition Standard Scratch (CSS) is a calculation made on any given day depending solely on 
        the scores of the players taking part and is an indication of how diffucult the course played. CSS can range from 1 lower than SSS to 3
        higher. If no CSS is provided for a round it will default to the course SSS`,
    note: `Please note these calculations are based off various WHS documentation and are not 100% accurate. The purpose of this 
        calculator is to give an indication of what your new World Handicap System (WHS) handicap will be when it is moved over to the new system.`
